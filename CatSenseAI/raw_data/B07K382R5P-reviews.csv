She got accustomed to using the litter robot after that.She uses it all the time now and no use for this anymore.It didn’t have much of a smell and it has a texture of dried spices.I deducted one star only because there was no option to buy just one bag.

"R30IDIYGAJVCAK","Kimberlynn B.","I was skeptical but this product works. I bought an automatic litter box and made the mistake of cycling it while they were watching and they were afraid of the litter box after that so I had to put the litter box on manual scoop mode in other words I would have to press the button to do it and I planned on putting a little curtain on it or something that I could cycle it without them watching LOL. I bought this litter additive to entice them to give the litter box a second chance and they did they're slowly warming up to the litter box again I put the other litter box that I scoop right next to it so they know that they are both to be used and I put litter additive only in the automatic litter box and initially the cat just went and sniffed around and then I found that when I wasn't looking one of them had gone in there and they are using it now more and more. This is worth the money and it will draw the cat into the litter box. The smell is very earthy. No dust from this product. The quality is good very effective without being obnoxious. No stickiness or anything like that. Very easy to incorporate into your litter. Just sprinkle it in and mix it in with your litter.

Up until then, she had been good about using the litter box and since she didn't have a health problem, I figured it was her objecting to the odor or that she was upset about something.  I tried many things but this is the only thing that worked.  It has a very grassy & catnippy smell that she must like because she is now using the litter box again.  I don't follow the instructions on the bag though - instead I just sprinkle it all over the top of the litter after I scoop it out so she can always smell it.

"R3M77P7OOVJDW1","/.","My 17 years old cat has begun to eliminate inappropriately (both kinds) next to her box instead of in it. We ruled out all medical reasons. A heaping 1/4 cup in sprinkled on top of her litter daily has caused her to occasionally use her box. I was very careful to ensure none of the product escaped the confines of my cat's box when I applied it. However, just as often as she will use the box, my cat will eliminate on the pads I placed around her box. So, the question is: does this mixture of herbs cause your cat to want to use their box as opposed to the adjacent floor? Probably not. Certainly not for this amount of money. I can't recommend this product for people in my situation. Two stars for a possibility of increased litter box use; I'm the optimistic sort. I'm still cleaning up pads every day, however could it be less often than before? Maybe. So, two stars for optimism.

We use more than recommended just to be sure(we use about a quarter cup per box and I think we could ween down a bit but why chance it) Also we give a treat if we hear him use the box, we also scoop frequently and clean boxes regularly.  There isn't much worse a smell of annoyance in a home  than that of inappropriately placed cat pee. It destroys carpet, clothes, bedding, furniture because even after cleaning  it is still somehow there.  It destroys relationships and trust too.This product contains herbal ingredients that help a kitty smell where they should be going so you pour a little over the litter and stir it in, then a blind or forgetful or urgent need kitty is drawn to appropriate behavior. It isn't a strong smell for us. Be careful when mixing in and pouring not to get any airborne or spill near the box  because they may go by the box if this happens. We think this product has and will save lives of kitties who have this difficulty.  They can turn it around  and be honorable members of your household society.  I know it is a little expensive to try but it is worth it to solve the problem.You should always make sure there is no medical reason for the inappropriate urine as kidney disease is prevelant in older cats and even younger cats get kidney stones or urinary infections.  Arthritis or pain can cause cats to not want to climb in to or jump in to the box, litter can hurt sensitive paws so you should explore every option to make your cat successful in their journey.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de julio de 2021","This is a miracle product, saving kitties and relationships","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
