"R3LYMQY0KLLAY7","NatRomero","La vd si atrajo a mi gato adulto que prefiere siempre ir al jardín, pero era un problema que quisiera ir durante la madrugada, por lo que opté por comprarle esta arena a ver si así ya lo convencía de ir a su arenero si es de noche, y sí empezó a ir. Seguro entre la textura y el olor le agradó, quizá se asemejó un poco más a la tierra del jardín. La he vuelto a comprar cuando mi gato decide que de nuevo no quiere usar su arenero.","Revisado en México el 30 de septiembre de 2024","La vd si atrajo a mi gato senior","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R2OCZ2MFT11MJM","Verónica Plascencia","Cuando Jerome llegó a mi hogar a los dos meses de edad, no sabía hacer en su arenero, después de liderar un poco con eso encontré esta arena que prometía resolver el problema con su tecnología de atrayente, y lo cumplió, apenas se la coloqué y mi gatito jamás volvió hacer fuera del arenero. Lo cierto es que cuando aprendió y decidí ponerle la arena que mi otro gato usaba al principio no le gusto mucho, me imagino que la textura porque está arena es mucho más ligera, al cambiársela le molestaba que la nueva se le quedaran algunos granos en sus patitas, lo supero rápido.

Recientemente recate a tres gatitos de apenas un mes que fueron tirados a la basura y al ser huérfanos y no tener una madre que los acicalara y los enseñara a hacer en su arenero sufrí lo mismo, hacían enseñara todos lados excepto su arenero, luego recordé la bendición que era este producto para entrenar a bebés para que aprendan a hacer en su arenero y nuevamente la bendición. Inmediatamente dejaron de hacer fuera. Estoy muy feliz con este producto, lo mega recomiendo para todo aquel que tenga este problema.

"R3BX08JF5VZZ0Z","Barbie","Why did you pick this product vs others?:Some issues I have with this litter is that if they are REALLY young kittens (like if you start litter-training them right at 3 weeks) I worry about it being a clumping kind of litter (like imagine if young kittens accidentally eat CLUMPING litter with how curious they are; it can clump in their GI tract & be fatal). I highly suggest if you *DO* want the easy cleanup clumping litter provides, maybe do a light layer of this underneath/mixed with larger natural based pellet litter instead & monitor closely or make sure they're on a scheduled potty time where you can watch them for a week or 2. (it's usually recommended that while training you use a natural nonclumping litter like pellets or corn-based litter & a very shallow cardboard box they can easily step into, then you can easily throw the whole thing out after when it's full). As they get older tho they might start digging more (whether out of boredom or playing) and kicking it around so it WILL create mess (kinda unavoidable), so keep that in mind as well. I think ours started doing that at about 7 weeks. The mess is not fun for sure and we did have issues with them accidentally stepping in the wrong spot after they'd use the bathroom sometimes for a little while so that would track gross mess too. The good things about it tho is the kitten attract DEFINITELY works because it was not difficult training them at all (although we did train them kinda later at 5 weeks instead of 3-4) they took right to it and had no issues making a habit out of going in the litterbox (getting them not to play in it was another issue lol). The clumping of course does make the clean up very easy; it's very absorbent. The odor control is as good as it can be when you have 3 kittens lol like as long as i'm on top of scooping we're good on the smell of course. Please just wait til their about 8 weeks as advertised on the package before using this for your kittens. go for pellets or corn-based (just anything natural and NON-clumping) for neonatal kittens younger than 8 weeks!!!!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de junio de 2025","Used this when litter-training - NOT USUALLY RECCOMMENDED FOR NEONATAL KITTENS!!!","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

She was happy or use it and would often seek it out but would also randomly choose to go to the toilet in other random places without rhyme or reason. Treat rewards didnt seem to have any effect and we'd come down each morning without know what we'd find and had resorted to putting bin bags and tin foil over the sofa when we weren't there or using it. Also in random corners of the room and plant pots 😅  We had tried everythingLiterally AS SOON as I put this litter in the tray, she used it and we have had no problems since. It's almost like she enjoys using it.

I have 3 kittens, one used the litter box consistently, the other 2 just went in the corner, on our carpeted floor!  The landlord would not be happy.  As soon as I put this litter in the box, they started using it instead of the variegated brown carpet (Yes, it is the LANDLORD'S fault) the carpet looks like a pile of dirt would.  Cats don't have very discerning eyesight.  In fact, after I put half the box in the 2 litter boxes, one kitten jumped IN the box, and starting pawing in it and playing in it.  The kittens, 3.5 months old all started going exclusively in the litter box.  It really does work to get kittens on the right track.  The only drawbacks are that when they urinate in it, it clumps up about one tenth of the litter box.  When I take out the soiled litter, it really uses up a lot of the litter.  I have to refill it very frequently, but it does save my carpet.  And it does seem to attract bugs and flies more than any other litter I have used - I probably need to clean it more often.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 16 de agosto de 2024","It really does attract kittens!","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

I’ve had my kitten for almost a week now, I had gotten him from someone who mainly kept him outside so when I got him he had been used to using the bathroom wherever and he didn’t really understand the concept of the litter box, I had been trying to keep him in the bathroom with the litter box for a couple hours at a time or anytime he’d try to go use the bathroom Id try to pick him up and throw him in the litter box and he’d just jump out, the first day of getting this litter he still was uncertain of it but to my surprise by the second day I seen him trying to urinate on my carpet so I put him in the litter box left the bathroom and come back to his feces in the litter box. Great stuff and will definitely recommend to anyone having issues with their kitten not using the litter box, the litter is very small and sandy like so I feel my kitten likes it better than the harder thicker litter only downsides i’ve had is it was a little dusty but nothing too serious & it is sorta pricey but definitely worth the money !","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de julio de 2024","Miracle worker for a first time cat mom !","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

Those attractants really are magic, drawing the kittens in (sometimes my adult cat will even sneak in to use their boxes despite having one all to himself). The majority of the kittens I foster are orphans and while litter box usage is mostly instinctual, having a quality litter definitely sets them up for success.It clumps well for both feces and urine.

There's no perfumes, it’s pleasant natural smell and small grains are perfect for kittens.This stuff clumps immediately and is easy to scoop and dispose of in a trash receptacle. The value is good, and it’s a better option than overly scented clay litter products that could bother kittens.I’ve had zero issues with cleaning the litter box since using this product. The low dust is amazing and a may under the litter box will collect any litter that remains in the kittens paws when they hop out of the litter box.This by far is the best quality litter I’ve ever used.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de mayo de 2024","Highly absorbent","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

I am a fan of the smaller grained litter - it scoops/sifts easier, I think.The downside is the cardboard box.

It's expensive, but it lasts a really long time with consistent cleaning and topping off with fresh litter every couple of days. I'm impressed.Edit #1: 4 stars. 1 of the 2 stubborn kittens is now using the box after a week. Not only that, but their mother who has been eliminating outside of the box for over a year, onto clothes, towels, anything available, has started using the box with this kitten litter! The last kitten is still being stubborn, she's still eliminating all over the place, so it's not 100%.Awesome clumping, decent odor control, easy to keep clean, low dust. It's good stuff but overpriced.Original review: 1 star. I have 4 kittens, 11 wks old, and their parents. 2 of the kittens refuse to use the box, no matter what I use or how many times I put them in it, even if they're already in the process of elimination, they still run out and do it elsewhere.

"R130KAS3NI466F","miss d.","Firstly it arrived with a leaking box, so it went all over my hallway floor.  I took it outside to transfer into the litter box and the leaking box got it all over my path.As for what my cat thought of it - he didn't want to use it at all and if I encouraged him into it, he hated how the little grains stuck in his paws so he'd flick it off - making lots of mess.The tracking is unlike anything I've ever had - extremely messy!  Leaves a sort of clay mess and the grains go everywhere.  They are still stuck in my cat's paws now.I cannot comment on smell reduction or clumping with my cat not using it.For an expensive litter I had much higher expectations.I am extremely disappointed and frustrated, I only have a lot more mess to clean up now and more wasted money.

It does attract the stubborn kittens that don’t want to use a litter box so that works. Cleaning brings a whole other set of problems, the clumps break apart and become too small for a scooper to get, frustrating especially when I clean the litter box twice a day. The reason I gave two stars is one of my two new kittens was refusing to use a litter box until this litter and every time I’m soaking paws or trying to clean the litter box calm myself by remembering that they both are using the litter box now.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de abril de 2024","Cement paws but attracts kittens","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R159KHSZ8KYJOJ","Barbara Thurlow","Well, this litter definitely attracted the little one, and he used the box very quickly.  But the clumping feature makes the litter so sticky when it gets wet that it sticks to his fur and dries there.  My kitty now has a mess on his little tail and feet.  I could not get it off with wipes or by trying to brush it out, so I am probably going to have to give the little guy a bath.This is a 3 week old kitten I have been fostering since he was 2 days old.

"RTI2808VNWQMY","Rob M.","I was super concerned that my baby girl kitten wasn’t going to be able to learn to use the litterbox. She was in the very beginning but after about of worms, she had a very painful stool passed in the litterbox and started associating it with the pain she was experiencing. She was going everywhere - under the bed, in the garage, under the computer table. I would try to time her feedings and put her in the litterbox, but she would freak out even going near it.I took a chance on this litter and followed directions - cleaned out the litterbox completely and replaced what was in it with this litter. She immediately loved this litter so much, she was playing in the litterbox for over an hour! And then a miracle, she used it! I was able to transition her from this litter to the litter we normally use with just one box. This stuff is well worth it! And it holds odor so well and clumps very well so you get more out of the litter than the nonclumping kind. My only complaint is that it comes in a cardboard box instead of a bag. The cardboard box leaks a bit at the bottom seam. But its still a five star product!

Some places I put two litters (courser grain and a finer grain) next to each other to see which got used more. Overall, it seems the finer grain wins over the courser litter but I still leave a course litter out with my mostly finer grain ones.

I generally avoid scented litter but this litter supposedly helps with the litter training.In the past, I have used regular litter for kittens with no problem.  In my opinion, this is a nice though not necessary product.I bought 2 boxes.  By the second box/two weeks later, I was mixing this litter with regular.  At this time, I also transitioned to a regular size/height litter box.  My 10 week old kitten had no problem with either the regular litter or regular size box.My kitten had only one out-of-litterbox accident before being litter-trained.  However, I don't know if this success was due to the litter or to the kitten.I would possibly recommend this litter for very young/small kittens (up to 10 weeks) or for a kitten that is having litter-training difficulty with regular litter.
