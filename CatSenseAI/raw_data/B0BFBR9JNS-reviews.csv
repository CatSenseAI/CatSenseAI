"R12TCBPYYV8P88","Melissa R","The best kitty litter I’ve ever used. My kitty doesn’t track it throughout my home, the ingredients are safe and is great at clumping which makes it easy to clean. The price is reasonable compared to other brands I’ve tried. But the best feature is that it absorbs the smells. Guests comment that my home does want smell bad like others.

Sticks to everything: the sides of the box, the scooper, does nothing for odor control, took me an hour and a half to salvage the litterbox and scoop, and the litter is expensive compared to cheaper/better quality litters.

"R1MK1K9LK6N6TW","Debbie Stroud","Over the years, with many of my cats, I have used different types of litter, trying to find the perfect one that will not trap odors and is very easy to clean up. I started using Dr. Elsey's Ultra cat litter several years ago, and it is great. It clumps well and does not have a lot of dust (very, very little in fact). Scooping is easy and does not break up as you scoop the clumps out. It is unscented, so I don't have to worry about my cats not liking it because of a smell.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 20 de diciembre de 2025","The best litter I've ever used","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","18 Pound (Pack of 1)"
"R1BAA0U7734ICS","Phil Clark","Went through a bunch of different litters before finding this one. Now we’re settled.

"RJPWQO912N1JK","super reader","This is our favorite litter, now on automatic order. We have 1 kitty and one top-entry covered litter box. We scoop once/day. While this is not a zero-track litter, it absolutely tracks MUCH less than any other similar litter. It does make a big difference. I also really appreciate that it is unscented while quite effectively managing any odor. (I personally find the smell of scented litter to be offensive. ) The only thing I dislike about this litter is that the package can be hard to carry as it is just the plastic bag with no handles of any kind. But, that’s a small issue given its overall performance. Definitely recommend! Kitty gives it two claws up as well!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de noviembre de 2025","Really is low tracking!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","0","18 Pound (Pack of 1)"

"RRCD46EHSXFX2","Corey","I first switched to Dr Elsey’s litter probably 10 years ago. I had a cat that kept going to the bathroom suddenly everywhere, but in the litter box. After binge watching my cat from hell, I think the show is called. I knew that she was doing it because she didn’t like something. I also took her to the vet to see if she had an infection but she did not previously I was using a very heavily scented Super lightweight litter from Walmart. I changed everything that she possibly could be hating about her litter box from removing the bag, to getting a bigger box, getting rid of the scented litter, getting rid of the lightweight litter that might get stuck in her feet, etc..

When I first tried this brand, it was the cat attract formula. I use that one or the one in the blue bag with some of the cat attract scent added in. It worked like a charm, and she started using the box again I kept using this brand in the blue bag because I really liked how hard it clumps when it clumps that hard. It’s super easy to scoop out and it keeps the rest of the litter, fresh or longer. I didn’t need the really strong smelling brand because it never stunk at all once I switched to this brand I’ve been a loyal user ever since.

A few months ago this style was on sale somewhere and I thought I would try it. Holy cow it’s even better than the blue style! It clumps just as hard, still no smell, and it really really does reduce the amount of tracking. It cost a little bit more than the other style, but it’s worth it. I’ve also noticed that I seem to go through less litter and the bags are lasting longer, so it actually might even be a better deal than the previous sale that I was using.

I highly recommend Dr. Elseys litter, no matter which style you choose. You really can’t go wrong. This is a really premium brand and worth every penny.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de octubre de 2025","Wow!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","18 Pound (Pack of 1)"

"RX2K22G870M7B","Gladis","Mmm diría que es relativamente decente, la verdad estaba buscando una opción más económica a la arena que utilizo (Fresh Step - Clean Paws), y también quería saber si había alguna que no dejara tanto rastro así como esa. Me gustó mucho el precio de Dr. Elsey’s y también aglutina muy bien. Honestamente no puedo seguir comprándolo porque siento que no oculta suficiente el aroma de la caja de arena; y eso que yo la limpio dos veces al día ya que tengo dos gatos machos adultos. La otra razón es que a mis gatos no les gustó la arena, se negaron a utilizarla la primera noche y después de eso se resignaron ya que no tenían otra opción pero aún así preferían votar la arena fuera de la caja que usarla.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de octubre de 2025","Más o menos","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","18 Pound (Pack of 1)"
