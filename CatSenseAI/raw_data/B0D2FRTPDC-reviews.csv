I don’t think I noticed a difference in the dust but this litter does not clump well at all when they pee.

The dried paw prints are also difficult to clean as they stick to the floor. I spent a couple of hours scrubbing carpets and mopping my floors yesterday.

If you have multiple cats, make sure you're cleaning this litter frequently the clumping on this litter is so bad. Once your cat pees a couple times the litter won't clump as good and the pee will spread throughout the whole litter.

"R2E6CMWHT3V5RG","Lynn","Tidy Cats Cat Litter Review 🐾I’ve been using Tidy Cats for a while now, and it’s become a staple in my household. With multiple cats, finding a litter that controls odor and clumps well is essential—and Tidy Cats delivers on both fronts.👍 Pros:• Excellent Odor Control: Even with two cats, the litter keeps smells at bay for days. The ammonia blocker really works.• Strong Clumping: Makes scooping easy and keeps the box cleaner longer.• Low Dust: Compared to other brands, it’s noticeably less dusty, which is great for my cats and my lungs.• Affordable & Widely Available: Easy to find in stores and reasonably priced for the quality.👎 Cons:• Heavy Container: The larger tubs can be a bit bulky to handle.• Tracking: Some granules still end up outside the box, though not as bad as others I’ve tried.Overall Verdict:Tidy Cats is a reliable, effective litter that balances performance and price. It’s not perfect, but for multi-cat households, it’s one of the best out there.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 6 de octubre de 2025","Tidy Cat litter","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"RXOIRWTYZNJAN","Breanna","Both of my cats are particular about their litter and it took me so long to find the best one that they like. I know they love this one since they do not go potty anywhere else anymore. Previously, they would poop in my bed or pee and thats how I knew they had a problem with their litter. This litter lasts long and smells great. I love the glade smell.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de enero de 2025","my cats favorite litter","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R2TCNCI0R5GDT5","Nicole","I used this in my litter robot and it worked great. I only purchased this because the normal brand I buy was out of stock. I really loved it at first, the texture looked great and light weight, the stickiness and absorbency were also on par however, this definitely not low tracking and dust which is very important for me. The litter is like small light weight little balls and they get EVERYWHERE!!I think this litter would be great if using for a litter box that is outside of the home such as in a garage, but not good for in-home.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 24 de enero de 2025","Horrible tracking and dust.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

Definitely worth the price.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2025","Very good","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R10DKLE9IPVSAX","Jenn M","Penny would like to let you know the sanctity of her litter box was violated by this defective product. The litter did not clump and was not as advertised in the product description. She wants you to know she requested that her owner continue to purchase Fresh Step Outstretch which is a far superior product.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 15 de enero de 2025","Does Not Clump at All","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R50XKV2PM0FIH","Nestor FPG","I recently switched to Purina Tidy Cats after using a ""premium"" litter that cost me $20 and barely lasted a month. The difference has been incredible! This litter offers the perfect balance of price, quality, and durability.The clumping is excellent, making cleanup easy and efficient. It also has a pleasant scent, thanks to the Glade Clear Springs fragrance, which helps keep the area fresh without being overpowering. My 5-month-old kitten approves too—she’s comfortable using it, and there’s no tracking mess.I’ve even experimented with mixing it with other components or additives, and it still performs wonderfully. For the price, this 16 lb. bag has exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a dependable and budget-friendly litter!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2025","Bang for the buck","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R265RKQ1SNYLK1","T. Warner","There was a tear in the bag so there was looose litter all over in the box, which would have been fine, but at some point it had to have gotten wet. There was a lot of it in clumps . I used what I could , maybe 1/2 the bag? And threw away the clumps . Not impressed,😞","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 14 de enero de 2025","Wasn’t in good shape when I recyit","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
