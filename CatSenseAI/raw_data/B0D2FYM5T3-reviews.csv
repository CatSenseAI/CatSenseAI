"R2OVCUO3IMI80Y","TsunamiMommy","Fantastic litter if you use it properly. I see folks saying it is sticky…if you have litter sticking to your cat box then you are not using enough litter. Think of a sandbox…need to be able to dig. I put about at least 4 inches in the box and have had no problems with scooping. And I have multiple cats. Nice hard round clumps that easily scoop. Odor control is fantastic but I scoop in the morning and again at night. With multiple cats I cannot leave the boxes to sit too long. I love that it clumps quickly and stays solid when scooped. No wasting of litter. If you get the big 38lb box, as I have switched to, then just cut the top enough to flip open and then use a small bowl or feed scoop to put litter in the cat box. This way you don’t have to lift the heavy box each time. All of my cats took to this litter immediately. I tried the pellet litter recently and they all went on strike. This litter is great!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de mayo de 2025","Great for our cats!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R3HI4WWBMGSMKD","Quinn Wolf","One of the better kitty litter options. I've tried almost all the different litters you can try. I ultimately need something affordable, odor control, and easy to clean. This one checks all those boxes. Smells fine even if you take a few days to get to it. The clumps don't fall apart.

"R2OIZJJ1BYEHU5","Edison Haydn","At first glance, cat litter is just another mundane household product—until you live with a feline companion and realize it’s the silent negotiator of dignity.

"R1F9RBN111VWE1","A J","At the time of purchase, I was looking for an affordable cat litter that would give the most bang for your buck. Boy, this product showed to have nothing valuable in exchange for the price. My cat is good about wiping his paws off almost all the way before he leaves the rubber mat that his litter box is on. But this product, was terrible. He could go for one use after just cleaning his box and sweeping the floors, and within 10 minutes it would look like a sandstorm came through the room. I was sweeping the room at minimum twice a day, justifying a purchase of a slightly more expensive litter. In fact, I was so let down by this product, that the next bag I bought was the opposite end of the spectrum- at $30 for a bag of the same weight. And I couldn't be happier. This new litter actually clumps, doesn't amplify the smell, doesn't end up in every nook and cranny of the house, and requires far less litter box maintenance-all things that Purina must have wanted to avoid when deciding to make this product. I was always hesitant to purchase anything with the name Purina on it, due to their dismal and unethical practices when it comes to pet food (when it comes to fillers, use of other pets or roadkill, and chemicals that hurts your cats health), but when looking to save a buck or two, I figured ""how could litter be anything like the same-litter's litter"". This litter is just as disappointing as their food- the only difference is that their food will harm my animal and the litter harms my mental health and sanity. Purina should dissolve and stop getting their products into the hands of pet owners, who love and care about their pets.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 26 de marzo de 2025","Be Ready To Clean Your Floors.....Constantly.","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
