It actually just makes the room smell like flowery animal waste. Our two cats had goopy eyes and started sneezing as soon as they started using this stuff.

The particles in this litter seem more dense than other types of clumping litter, cutting down on both dust and smell. My wife even pointed out that the cats don’t track it out of the litter box as much as other types we tried, likely due to the litter grains being heavier.

"RWV8988PIGKD4","Mike W","I've tried so many brands of clumping litter that claim to be ""dust free"" or ""low dust"", but they never live up to the promise and always produce clouds of dust every time the litter is moved around at all. This leads to more cleaning in my apartment, but more importantly I've been concerned over the health of my cat breathing in that dust when he uses the litter box. Eventually after trying more litters, I came across this one and was astonished at the fact that there is literally zero dust no matter how much I stir it around. Not only that, but as a bonus, it causes significantly less tracking outside of the litter box than any other brand I've tested. There's a bit of a light scent to the litter but luckily it doesn't seem to bother my cat at all.

Not only does it do an excellent job of controlling odors, but the cloud control feature truly makes a difference. The litter is nearly dust-free, which means no more clouds of dust when scooping or pouring, and my litter box area stays noticeably cleaner.

I’ve also noticed my cats seem more comfortable and less irritated when using the box, likely due to the low-dust formula. Cleaning up is so much easier, and I don’t have to worry about tracking dust or debris all over the house. This product is a game-changer for anyone who wants a cleaner, healthier environment for their pets and themselves.

"R1BI88XTAQZS7C","MP","UPDATE: I mixed this litter with another (Purina lightweight) instead of leaving it to waste. Both litter are advertised as high odor control, but I think otherwise. The odor of wastes (poops and urine) stays for hours, and clumping is not as well, which causes the wastes to stick to the wall when cleaning and leave residues. I was too early to leave the original review, given I used it for less than 24 hours.

ORIGINAL: It seems to have good odor control and clump well. I used it with an automatic litter box and the main issue is the tracking because the litter is so fine like sand. It may not be compatible for automatic litter box.

My cat was enjoying it too much that she couldn’t stop feeling like beach digging days :/ I had to urgently buy a different litter and stopped using this within 24 hours.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de noviembre de 2025","OK but not for automatic litter box","3.0 de 5 estrellas","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif","0",

I'm glad I don't have to get my nose and lungs full of dust when scooping, and I love the lower dust level in the room, especially because I have to have my litter box in the same room as our piano.

I have had litters that tracked less, but also litters that tracked more. I would describe this as fairly low tracking in that it typically stays in the room with the litter box and doesn't get elsewhere in the house.

"R3NFPYRS75YEMV","M MADSON","This litter kicks up absolutely NO dust at all! Not when you pour it in the box and not when you scoop the box. The litter I normally use sends up clouds of dust anytime the litter is disturbed, including when the cats are digging around in it. The area around the large box I have constantly needs dusting and sweeping.

It doesn't seem to be tracking outside of the box either. My boxes are actually large sterilite plastic tubs, I have huge cats and they don't fit in most boxes, so they have to literally jump out of the box. Even though I have rugs around them to catch stray litter, they still manege to track litter all over. Since I started using this litter, the tracking is nominal. The clumps are fairly hard and don't break up when scooping, so it scoops clean. There is no apparent odor to it, and my cats didn't seem to notice the change in the litter.

I live in a household with multiple cats using the boxes and even though I scoop twice daily, as the litter ages, the odor starts to come out. I will update the review once I can tell if that's not as bad either, but for now, I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a quality litter. I even sent some to a friend who is highly allergic to dust and she hasn't indicated any problems with it.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 22 de septiembre de 2025","Dust free perfection!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R3MY98BDUL3QBW","Jenny Q.","First, when I purchased the liter I was expecting a bigger box and more durable container. The litter is very sand like an is durable but it does get stuck to there paws and makes a mess. So it does track everywhere. No moisture. Nothing to say about the fit. I would say the durability is a 4 out of 10.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de septiembre de 2025","Cat litter","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R2BO3W0QP2GIAY","Janice M.","After my cat had some urinary tract issues, I made the switch to the cloud-free/control formula—and it’s been smooth sailing ever since. No flare-ups, no drama, just a happy kitty and a relieved human. Bonus points for the 18lb box option: it’s the perfect size—not so heavy that you feel like you're training for a strongman competition, but still enough to last a while.

I even send this litter to my elderly father for his cat, and he can handle the box without needing a forklift or a pep talk. It’s a win-win: good for the cats, easy on the humans, and no mysterious clouds of dust floating around like a haunted litter box.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de septiembre de 2025","Cloud-Free and Worry-Free","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R30QU0CN044PA9","Matthew","I was just starting to transition my cat onto this litter, and after the mix was 25% this and 75% Arm and Hammer Platinum SLIDE, when the urine rocks became as sticky as chewing gum. Since I have an automatic litter box, this created numerous disgusting messes that resulted from the sticky rocks rolling around in the box, and even ejecting outside it (and getting gobbled up by my robot vacuum). It's been impossible to clean out of the litter mats I've been using, and to top it off, this litter has absolutely no odor control.

Okay, but sure, there's less dust.

Things got better after I switched back to SLIDE. I now have a whole box of this stuff left, so I wasted my money.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de septiembre de 2025","Stickiest litter I've ever seen","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R1PCMYNECD5K07","Santi13","I honestly don’t think I’ve ever been so excited to write a raving review in my life! This litter is legit. Let me begin by saying; we are a 3 kitty family. So, anywhere we can save when it comes to animal cost is major, because of that we have been purchasing a brand name litter from Costco for years now. The litter box is kept in the laundry room and my kids are usually on litter duty so I never really noticed an issue, with the exception of dust build up. Recently, I took over scooping, and oh my good gracious, the amount of dust cloud that came from that old litter was enough to give you an allergy attack. Not to mention, the increasing amount of litter dust throughout my laundry room. GROSS!
Anyways, I decided I had enough and looked into an alternative option. That’s when I found this Cloud control litter by arm & hammer. I am in absolute awe of this litter and its lack of dust or cloudy aftermath! Like, literal shock and so mad at myself for not buying it sooner. The litter itself is more of a sand like texture, so a bit lighter than other litters. It seems to clump well, and scoop easily. Although because of the texture, it does track a bit more than our old one. No biggie if you have a litter mat! The smell is a nice clean fresh scent, but not overwhelming or artificial smelling. I honestly don’t know if the 14 day claim on this litter is accurate, because I just started using it and I was too darn excited about the product that I just had to stop and write this review. I also immediately ordered another box to have as backup and now have this litter on my subscription. It’s is a bit more on the pricey side, but I would say the value of this litter is 100 percent worth a bit more cost.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 27 de agosto de 2025","Cloud Control is on Point!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
