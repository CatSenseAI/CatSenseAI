Its clumping, works well, and barely tracks. Which is the biggest bonus of them all. That is why I have tried all the litters. Even the super expensive fancy schmancy kinds, dont beat out this one for tracking. My cat, has as bit of lasting brain damage from when I rescued him. He has always made a terrible mess of his litter box area and needs a hooded box, plus a litterbox enclosure with a maze to get out and then a rug on the floor outside of the enclosure. Even that- the mess was insane. And we were going through the litter! This one? Vacuum once or twice a week outside of the enclosure (instead of 2x daily) and my laundry room floors are finally litter free for months now thanks to this fantastic brand. Absorbs well, the unscented truly has no smell but the scented kinds arent overpowering like some brands.

"RL8ZJ703P2H44","MaHurl","Title: The Holy Grail of Cat Litter!

Okay, let me just say, if cat litter were a reality TV star, Dr. Elsey’s would be the undisputed queen! We’ve been on this litter journey since 2019, and after trying a handful of other brands (out of sheer curiosity, I swear!), we always end up back at Dr. E’s. Trust me, it's like dating a nice guy and then realizing you miss the one who always made you laugh!

First off, the Clean Tracks clumping clay litter is a game changer. It clumps like it’s training for the Olympics—seriously, I’m impressed! Cleaning out the litter box has gone from a dreaded chore to a slightly less-dreadful chore. My cat gets to do her business, and I get to scoop without feeling like I’m wrestling a greased pig.

And let’s talk about the smell… or the lack thereof! I swear, my house could be hosting a cat party and most guests wouldn’t even know we have a litter box. No stinky surprises here—just a fresh-smelling home (even if my cat’s breath is another story).

The convenience of Amazon’s Subscribe and Save? It’s like having a cat litter fairy! I don’t have to lug 40 pounds of litter from the store—thank you, delivery gods! Plus, it’s always set to arrive just when I need it, so I never panic like I did when I thought we were running low and had to make an emergency trip to the store. (Let me tell you, not the most glamorous of outings.)

We usually mix this with the blue bag, which I consider a fine wine pairing for our feline’s litter box—only the best for my furry overlord! So, if you're still out there trying to find ""the one,"" do yourself a favor: grab a bag (or three) of Dr. Elsey’s and bask in the glorious cleanliness. Just don’t blame me when you become a litter snob like us!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de octubre de 2025","Holy Grail! Stop searching this is ""THE ONE""!

"R2DUMC3U6SF7KW","Amazon Customer","Having had cats or 20 plus years, I think I know a thing or two about litter! Like many of you, I've tried soooooo many different ones, from corn, clay, wood and crystals! Looking for affordable, odor controlling litter, that the cats actually seem to like.
This litter is the best I've tried. It keeps the odor totally under control even if you miss a day of scooping. Clumps perfectly and tracking is minimal as well. I think its a very good price for such a high quality litter.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 19 de septiembre de 2025","great product","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",,"Limpiar pistas","39.99 Pound (Pack of 1)"

"R12IJK7C98Q934","Dreamer","I gave this two stars because although it did not work for me, it’s still good value for the amount of litter that you get. The quality looks good too. My issue is that it is almost impossible to scrape the litter off of the bottom of thd litter box when cleaning it out or even scooping. It hardens so much that I literally put in a lot of elbow grease to scrape the bottom of the (stainless steel) litter box. It was a miserable experience. I did that once and I will not be doing it again.

"R1NTC6P4K8FM3P","Jeannie","We absolutely love Dr. Elsey’s Ultra Unscented Clumping Clay Cat Litter! We have four cats all using the same litter box, and this litter handles it amazingly well. It clumps tightly, controls odor, and stays fresh much longer than other brands we’ve tried.

The unscented formula is a huge plus with no heavy perfumes, just clean and effective. It’s low dust, easy to scoop, and keeps the area neat. We’ve been using it for years and have purchased it 39 times since 2020, that’s how much we love and trust it!

Pros:
• Excellent clumping and odor control
• Truly unscented
• Low dust and easy to clean
• Works great even with multiple cats

Cons:
• None, it’s perfect for our household
