"R2PFOOD2PWYACR","Ninja Gaijin","Didn't work for my cat. But she had physical issues including IBD and anal gland impaction, so 'attractants' weren't going to help litter avoidance as she related the pain of bowel movements to the litter trays, or went next to the tray, to show me there was a problem. However maybe this product will work for you if you just have a cat that is not used to using litter trays and needs some more motivation to do so.However I'm lucky that all the feral cats I've socialised just 'know' what to do naturally..I recommend if you take in a feral cat, it's best to crate train them for a few days or a week so they are confined with the litter tray at first, until they get used to using it.","Revisado en Australia el 7 de enero de 2026","Didn't work for my cat, but it was a medical issue - maybe will work for yours","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","1 Pack"

As soon as I started mixing this in, she started using it again. You don’t have to use very much of it so it definitely lasts a long time. It does have a little bit of an earthy smell to it but it’s not overwhelming at all. I didn’t notice any changes to the functionality of the litter.

"R25QB8NYR324XS","spiritofthewoman","Update: this one bag of attractant has lasted me just over a year for one cat with two litter boxes.Excellent value!I'm caring for a very elderly Siamese mix who has sensory processing issues around the litter box.  The Cat Attract products have been essential in helping him keep using his litter boxes.  He went from improvising locations around the house, to sticking to the box.  He still has occasions he will get freaked out and revert to going in front of or next to the box, but that's happened if I've made too big of a change to it for his comfort.  I've been able to transition him to a new type of litter three times by sprinkling a heaping tablespoon or two of this attractant over the top to be mixed in.What prompted me to remember to write a review after eight months of success with this product is  that I forgot to sprinkle this on top of a new scent of tofu litter yesterday, and he went in front of his box again for the first time in months.  He's a good cat I'm happy to support through his golden years, and the cat attract  has been transformative and very reasonably priced.  I've tried the Feliway pheremone spray, and some repellent spray which idk how effective they are, while this item I KNOW how effective  it is.","Revisado en Canadá el 15 de agosto de 2024","Helps my senior cat so much","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","1 Pack"

"R2BMKUZP3SCADX","Amazon Customer","I got this originally for my cats who were too afraid to use my litter robot. My cats were interested in this product, but this really just seems like a big bag of catnip.

"R3J4L317S6U05J","Sabrina","This product works amazing!!! I don’t like to mix a whole bunch in the litter but sometimes the sound of the bag draws curiosity to the cat. I then head towards the litter box and use a tiny sprinkle of it in front of the cat so he can really smell it and in he goes and does his business. This also worked well for us when we got a new automatic litter box and he was transitioning from a regular box to the new one. It also smells great similar to fresh grass","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de noviembre de 2023","Amazing!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","1 Pack"

"R26H8ZYH722P64","Busybee","I have been using this product for 3 weeks so far. I have an older cat who was soiling outside of the litter box. This product is a nice blend of various spices and other ingredients.  The scent is not unpleasant and you don't smell all over the house. He took an immediate interest in it. He is now almost 100% back to using the litter box. I also have 2 rescue young cats that were not litter trained very well. Using this product has so far cut their accidents in half. I'm going to increase the amount I use to see if that encourages them even more to use the litter boxes.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 5 de noviembre de 2023","Litter box attraction","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","1 Pack"
"R1YO8MIQQEVHSS","Kindle Customer","We have an older cat who had begun not quite using the box. A friend recommended this after they had a stressed male cat marking the house indiscriminately and this worked for them. Well, it works for us too. Our dear old mess maker has begun to use her box again instead of defecating beside the box or four feet away from the box.  If I see that she has used her box, I sieve it, then sprinkle a fresh dazzle of this stuff over the litter and it works again. SO HAPPY! I can't recommend this enough.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 4 de noviembre de 2023","It works","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0","1 Pack"
"R1E78BT4MYE4QS","This is AMAZING!🤩. My 7 year old cat started urinating outside the litter box. It was so frustrating. I took him to vet and ran every test available and it proved it was behavioral. I tried everything over a two month period, extra litter boxes, new litter, bigger boxes, lower boxes, you name it. I bought this attractant and paired it with Dr. Elsey litter and problem solved. I’m so happy!!!! This is so great!!!!!","This is amazing.
