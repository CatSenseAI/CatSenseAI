"R45RWCD62OYQG","Lizzy Blue","This is hands down the best clumping litter on the market. I tried just about everything out there, including other A&H and some of the more expensive litters, until I found this one. I travel full time with my cat in a 22’ trailer. In such a small space you can’t escape a bad odor. This is the only litter that really works. However, the box is a bit heavy, so I recently tried a couple of lightweight litters, including A&H Hardball. Never again. They were terrible. From now on I’ll deal with the weight and stick with a litter I know works.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de enero de 2026","Never switching again","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R44D9CYPJW1RR","La","The ARM & Hammer Clump & Seal Platinum Cat Litter has become a staple in our home. What stands out immediately is how excellent the clumping is — truly one of the best we’ve used. Because it forms such solid, tight clumps, it works beautifully with our automatic litter box. The better the clumping, the smoother the machine runs, and this litter delivers every time.

When the box is cleaned regularly, the odor control is impressively low, keeping the space fresh and manageable. Like any litter, if it’s forgotten for a few days, the smell does creep in — but that’s more of a universal truth than a flaw of this brand. Same truth with the weight, par for the course.

It can get a little messy and slightly dusty, but honestly, that’s par for the course with most litters. The dust level here is mild enough that it doesn’t bother us or our cat, and the performance more than makes up for it.

What really seals the deal is the value. For the quantity you get, this is one of the best-priced litters out there, especially considering how well it clumps and how compatible it is with automatic systems. It’s absolutely worth the money, and we’ll keep buying it.

Highly recommend for anyone with an automatic litter box or anyone who wants strong clumping without breaking the bank.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de enero de 2026","Reliable, Affordable, and Perfect for Automatic Litter Boxes!","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

This second batch I got was more similar to your typical clumping litter, light grey and rocky. I want to know what I’m getting when I buy a product, especially when it comes in an opaque box.

"R2670EV6I06ERY","Amazon Customer","This is.the best cat litter that I have ever used! All my life I have had cats, and have been through mountains of litter, but for me they have all been ineffective or so very dusty that my kitty room looked like someone had sprinkled clay dust ALL OVER the room,but this litter has exceeded my expectations!! And number one after she goes I can’t detect any odor at all, in fact I have to check to make sure that she does go! And last but not least NO DUST, what else can you ask from a cat litter?? I have found a keeper with this litter","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 2 de octubre de 2025","A Keeper","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
