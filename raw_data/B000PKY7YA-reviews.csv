"RBX0634DL83GJ","Bridgette","We’ve been using this litter for a while now and it works very well for our cat.The clumps form quickly and are easy to scoop, which makes cleaning the litter box much easier. It also does a good job controlling odor and doesn’t track too much around the house.What I like most is how low the dust is compared to other brands we’ve tried. It feels cleaner when pouring and scooping.

From the very first day, he used this litter box consistently and now he refuses to use any other litter! The clumping is excellent, it controls odor well, and there’s very little dust.I have two cats and three litter boxes, and while my other cat uses the other boxes fine, my kitten insists on the one with this litter. It clearly works as advertised,the attractant really encourages cats to use it, which has saved me a lot of stress and cleanup.If you have a cat who’s picky or avoiding the litter box, this is worth every penny.

"R31SEOVM4OE8SO","Mike","This cat letter truly sucks for roughly $35 a bag with tax, it's not what they claim it to be as far as hard clumping, I bought It for a very expensive automatic cat box that I purchased also on Amazon so it would be less maintenance for me but every time the cat box goes to empty, there are huge clay  Clumps stuck to the bottom that I have to go in and clean out myself. Even though I have it set to automatically let it clean itself after 5 minutes. There's no reason if this is hard clumping, that it should be sticking to the bottom of the cat box. This is the most worthless product. If I did not have 4 bags, and it was 40 miles for me to return it to U. P.

"R3PNALJP2M9ZS","Carlyn W","I have 3 cats, and one has struggled to consistently use the litter box for the last year. We ruled out medical problems and confirmed it's due to stress. I tried all of the recommended stress relievers: extra litter boxes, different styles of boxes, pheromone diffusers/collars, calming treats, and even her own private room the other cats can't reach. Nothing was working. Only thing that worked was to kick her outside during the day.

We recently moved and she needs to stay indoors, and I've been struggling with the accidents.

I can't believe I didn't stumble on this litter sooner. I added a box of this and she hasn't had an accident since! It's been over a week so far. Not to mention the odor control and tight clumps are amazing. It isn't dusty like most clay litters are. Perhaps a bit pricey, but cheaper than the natural corn/cassava or grass seed-based litter I bought!

If this litter isn't the golden ticket for your cat, step back and assess if there's a medical problem or other stress factors and try to eliminate those before calling the litter a failure!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 9 de diciembre de 2025","Holy Grail!

The litter turns into the consistency of wet cement and cannot be scooped but must be dug out with a metal scoop and is used up pretty quickly for an expensive litter.  It still tracks and I have litter mats outside the box. The plus side is that it does mask  the odor of the box. Might work well for younger cats.

He now is on special prescription food for the rest of his life. So when this started happening, I immediately thought it was his way of telling me he had them again. After a trip to the vet I learned that he was doing it because he probably just didn’t like the litter I was using. So I got him a new stainless steel monster size litter box and changed the litter to this brand. He really seems to like both, the new huge litter box and the new litter. He hasn’t gone outside of the box at all since. I noticed right away that it doesn’t get stuck in between his little toe beans because he’s not scraping them on the side of the box.

"RUEWOE7E3GUKR","andrea","So thankful for this kitty litter. Not only is it reasonably priced it’s an amazing product worth every penny.  My cat started tinkling outside of the box, likely anxiety but we couldn’t figured it out. We tried everything and once we switched to this (admittedly the supplemental cat attract blue product) we had no more accidents or intentional problemsFor years since we have stayed with this product and will not go back.  It’s not chalky.  It clumps great allowing you to scoop and remove waste to get extended use out of the product.  It helps with odor and isn’t super dusty. Doesn’t stay in my cats paws to track around house either.  It has a money back guarantee for a reason - it’s amazing.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 25 de junio de 2025","Best Litter out there!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

I don’t notice the litter tracking around the house but we have mats around the litter boxes.

"R1HFMPKYCYNNLC","Heather H.","We had to go out of town to stay with a relative in hospice and left my daughter staying with my cats. They revolted and to spite me for leaving them left me a huge mess to clean, and in the process, sort of untrained themselves. I was at wits end, when a friend from rescue suggested this amazing product. I had never heard of it, but now it is all we use. It seems expensive at first, but because it clumps so tightly, there’s never a slushy pee at the bottom of the box, so you never have to fully dump and wash the box. You just scoop - comes out completely clean, no odors! - and add a bit as it gets low. The attractive agent draws the cats right in. Within a day, my cats were using their boxes again like champs. I now buy 1/3 of the cat litter we were buying and am actually saving money only buying this brand. Saving labor, smells, and,frustration, too. Highly recommend.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 13 de junio de 2025","Solution For Cats that Pee Outside the Box - This Works!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VKC7vp82L.jpg","0",

"R30MPT2BRGAZW2","Perfect Stranger","The manufacturer claims ""no dust"", though the last ordered bag of litter was very dusty and overall of a much lower quality than before. It has happened once or twice in the past 9 years, however, this last time it was very bad. It is unfortunate that I opened this bage just a few days ago and missed the window of returning the product.

"ROWMZC77OELMC","Karen E","This cat litter is absolutely horrible. The smell of cat pee is so strong, even when there is very little in the box, it is overwhelming. The only reason I would give it 1 star is because it clumps just fine. I didn’t even finish the bag, I could not take the smell. I went back to my old litter because it prevented the horrible smell, but it tracks all over the place. I will keep looking for a good alternative….this was not it.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 28 de mayo de 2025","Not bad if you don’t mind the smell of cat pee","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

The 40lb bag is pretty heavy (it's 40 pounds) but it's also the most cost effective so count me in. I use it with my litter robot and it isn't too dusty to the point where I constantly need to be cleaning sensors.
