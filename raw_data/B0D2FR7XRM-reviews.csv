"R2I1Q6SFE6O7WT","Makayla Vincent","I have two 2-year old cats who are very picky about their litter. My female was in a less than ideal situation before I adopted her, and her paws are very sensitive. We have had good luck with Tidy Cats, particularly with the 24/7 one. The litter is soft enough that my Penelope doesn't mind stepping on it for its intended purpose, but firm enough that it clumps together well after the fact. It has a relatively subtle clean smell to it. I feel like it does a good job to cover the scent of urine, but doesn't help the smell of feces much (which is okay - I use this litter with an auto-cleaning box so it doesn't stick around for long). In between auto-raking, I also manually scoop, which is easy enough due to the clumping. It is a bit dusty to pour in, as you can see from the video. But once its initially poured in, the dust amount is low. My cats both jump out of the litter box like wild beasts instead of just stepping out like civilized pets, so I can't speak on the efficiency of tracking. But I can tell you that cleaning around the litter box itself is easy enough either with a broom or vacuum. I like this brand overall, and think its a good product for the price.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2026","Good Litter, Good Value","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
