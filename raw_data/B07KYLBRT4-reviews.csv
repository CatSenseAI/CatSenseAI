I even find litter in his food bowl, which means possibly he ingested some.Often got stuck on my cat’s paws like a gum and I had to clean his paws and fur.

"R3A6NRFX6H3ICG","Crash","I have ALWAYS had kittens/cats in my life from a very young’n lil girl to the present and mostly not just one but multiple strays that seem to find me before I find them!

In my 53 years young and almost another one about to be added, I haven’t found one cat litter that did what it says it does as they all at least have 1 things they claim that it doesn’t do.

It’s always a nuisance, mess, and the worst chore that one quickly puts off until the litter is clay / mud, your scoop is covered with the sticky goo and what little flecks managed to survive the procrastination can easily be found all over your floor, carpet and ugh, sadly even on the counter.

It doesn’t matter if you just bleached the community restroom all in one small box and put brand new litter, that, “whatever smell claimed,” may smell great a refreshing right then but as soon as 4 paws of fur ball jump inside for that private moment, you are going to smell whatever number 1 or 2 rapidly climbing your nose that seems to only intensify with the need to cover that never seems to ever cover what it was suppose to.

It’s not just this brand of litter, it’s across the board these days but, at least they are making an attempt and that’s a plus in my book for any business!","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 21 de enero de 2026","Cats Paw Not Pleasantly Pristine","2.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"RCIYGMB3CDQG3","LORI","Horrible. Woke up to one hot mess... Writing this review before coffee I'm so disenchanted. The litter sticks to the bottom of Bebe's feet in small clumps if it gets wet. A few of the tiny clumps are all over the house and I have an exterior litter catcher rug outside his box. What was stuck to his foot does not want to come off - it's like beads of plaster that adhered to his foot fur and don't want to come off. So what... he's supposed to lick that ""stuff"" off? Not on my watch. I recommend wetting it to get it off. Bebe had little patience for that.

"R38P2STA20V2GC","J. Hamilton","I am a dedicated user of Tidy Cats Free and Clean litter. I manage a cat rescue and use about 15 boxes of the stuff every month. I ordered this larger size box, thinking it would be more convenient. Sadly, the litter was not the same as I get in the smaller boxes. It was a different texture and was way more dusty than I can tolerate in a shelter setting. I will not purchase it again.","Revisado en Canadá el 13 de octubre de 2025","A bit disappointed","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R32RM5I4ZB9GZD","Arayna Grace","This is our go-to litter for the feline overlords. In an effort to make sure they don't stink up the house, we like the light scent of the free and clean. They like it so much that they dislike it when we move to a different brand (picky things). So, I try to keep this one on regular ordering. We prefer the lightweight, because no one needs to throw out their back over litter. Scoops well and has light dust.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 12 de octubre de 2025","Overlords have to use the bathroom,too.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R1EV3G931KQUJH","Anne","This is probably the worst tracking litter I’ve ever purchased in the 12 years I’ve had a cat. I’ve had to vacuum every single morning. It’s not just contained to the litter box area either it’s out the closet, into the hallway, and down the hall. I’ve never in my life. I’m assuming the cat isn’t enjoying it either.

Love the unscented you don’t have the heavy smell of oh there’s a litter box somewhere near cat lives here.

To note would recommend dust free, it does get tracked out of the litter box on the floor either way but helps, but my cat being mean may just bully me.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de octubre de 2025","Would recommend!!","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

- I feel the litter is good quality however I feel it is only good if you have one cat. If you have more than one cat thats where I would not recommend this litter do to it going quite quickly.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de octubre de 2025","Ok for one cat","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R3HKUDTYSEV1B4","Morgan","I really wanted to like this stuff. It's the easiest litter to pour + spread + carry around given how light it is. But genuinely it doesn't conceal odors. We keep our cat's litter box in a litter cabinet in our closet, so things usually don't smell at all, but with this litter I can't go 2-3 days without the closet and hallway smelling strongly of ammonia. Compared to Arm & Hammer, this stuff is a joke.

"R3N8AY2H3140NI","Debbie Taylor","Zero stars. I've used this product (unscented) for years. The last 2 boxes Have Not Worked - it stopped clumping. Now it just makes the litter a darker color and it now smells horrible, making my entire house smell. And it isn't sticking to poo, any more. Why the formula change?
I left a review for the same thing on a scented version which was shipped because this unscented version was out of stock. I'd rather buy the $5.99 cheapest litter than this product-at least that cheap stuff absorbs urine; urine just puddles like wet dirt with this product.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de septiembre de 2025","Do Not Buy-No Longer Absorbs or Clumps","1.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
