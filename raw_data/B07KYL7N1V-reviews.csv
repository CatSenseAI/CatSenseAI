"R5COJCNJTRXRY","Amazon Customer","I switched to this litter because they discontinued Arm and Hammer Light Weight. ( For what reason? I have no idea. Very minimal dust, tracking and solid clumps. I read these reviews, and they sound like they’re describing a completely different litter! This litter is horrible! It tracks like cement, the dust is blinding, I can’t even pour it due to the fact that I choke from the dust that comes out with the litter. Scooping it in doesn’t make a huge difference either.  I wake up every morning  to a coating of dust and tracked litter hardened on my wood floors. I hardly ever write reviews unless  a product  or purchase is either  fabulous or terrible.

"R1BIE23Z4HGLI1","Jill","I decided to try a different type of litter after using corn based litter for 6 years. My old litter is great, I just wanted to try something new.

I will not buy this particular type of litter again after using it for 3 months.

Stickiness/Clumping: It clumps very slowly, forming a sticky wet puddle in the litter box regardless of the amount of litter I add to the box. This mess ends up sticking to my cat’s paws and belly, and it’s very hard to get them off. Ironically, the little clumps once it makes contact with my cat’s paws. I spend 10 minutes removing litter from his paws and his belly every time he gets out.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de octubre de 2025","Sticky mess…","2.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R3DAO845HPB5F","Laura","Used for so many years with no issue. I have since changed brands, but for reasons that don't concern the brand Tidy Cats directly (I try to go for corn-based now). Their litter is great. It does have a basic litter smell, but does a good job at trapping cat odors. It's not especially dusty on my medium-hair black cat either (nothing is perfect with a black cat though lol), and seems to like it just fine too, never had issues with the texture or anything. The lightweight aspect always made it easy for me to carry a box home, if I couldn't get it delivered through amazon.I actually still do use it a bit. I use 50/50 of this, with the other part being corn-based litter. I find the corn litter struggles a bit more with cat odors, but has a gentler basic smell. Combining the two litters gives out a great balance for odor control!","Revisado en Canadá el 6 de junio de 2025","Great value litter","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"RHMMEG44OIXX1","Madison","It’s SO lightweight and scoops so easily. I was amazed at first clean up.
But my kitten is leaving clay like foot prints everywhere after leaving the box. So maybe my kitten just messy or it’s the litter. It’s never happened before with the litter I had before this","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 3 de junio de 2024","Unsure if normal","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R35PQ0XGV2YNEA","Robin","This is top notch kitty litter! Personally I like the unscented! Apparently so do lots of others as it’s often sold out! Thank goodness the scented one works just as well. I just prefer zero scent in my home.  Such a great product! It lasts twice as long as other litters and clumps beautifully!Live it!!!!","Revisado en Canadá el 31 de mayo de 2024","It lasts twice as long as other litters!","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R3W21EX1NBQZID","Latricia J.","I hate litter boxes in the house. I wish I lived in the country; I’d keep my cats in a catio instead of in my house. I love the little stink ball though. This litter smells nice, & stays smelling relatively nice as long as the box is cleaned regularly during the day.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de mayo de 2024","The scent is so pleasant","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R4T74NLD85VF9","Beth","We found that the Purina Tidy Cats Litter was every thing it was said it was.  We found though that the Purina Tide Litter sticks to the fur of the cats and sends it around  the house and we are for ever sweeping up the litter.  We are still going to use the Purina Tidy Cats litter.","Revisado en Canadá el 2 de mayo de 2024","Purina Tidy Cats Light Weight Low Dust ,Clumping Cat Litter","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
