"R1CAG18U1FDCQC","soulsearcher","Love this stuff, never going back. But, as you replace your cat box, if at all possible, do it outside. This is not dustproof. You'll  be dusting nearby items. After the initial filling, it's  great. I scoop her box every night and wipe wet spots down with a neutralize and replace lost sand. So, this item can last and control order for a long time- maybe up to a month, with my routine. Awesome! Because who likes cleaning a litter box anyway? And who would leave poop in their own toilet?? Ew.I can't  really comment on litter tracking because she is very thorough about her paw wiping- good girl!Side note: I fill mine kind of deep so she can FULLY bury.  Even aside from the daily scoop and neutralizer, I find that sand depth makes a HUGE difference for odor control. Yes, initially it cost a little more to do that but in the long run? It lasts longer, works better and you actually save money.** PLEASE, provide a LID COVERED, privacy cat box,  kitty will love you for it!

"R2APNXEBRJX8KK","rpv","This used to come in a big box, which was heavy, but it worked.  It now comes in 4 small bags.  Much lighter, but the bags are TERRIBLE.  (1) They are very difficult to open.  The bags are ""perforated"", but don't tear along the perforation, or if they do, the perforation isn't below the sealing point, and you need scissors anyway to open the bag.  (2) They are ""resealable""?  Hah!  The tape is very hard to get off, and once off, doesn't want to reseal.  So I keep a 1-gallon plastic pitcher by the litter box and, once I open the bag, I pour what's left into the pitcher.But I do like the litter.  It clumps nicely.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 7 de agosto de 2022","Love the litter and price, the packaging is AWFUL.","3.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

While springing from her litter box, one back foot would land in the wet litter. It would stick to her paw and become rock hard. It would hurt her when I would try to remove it. This is probably an individual problem because of my cats weird bathroom habit.

However, since the redesign of the packaging…1) how much am I spending in the packaging versus the litter? The amount of plastic packaging has at least tripled.2) how many layers of packaging do I need to go through? Is there really that big of a risk of punctures, soils, or tampering?3) how many more minutes do I need to spend on an already tedious and loathsome task?4) what was the point of the smaller bags within the larger package? Were there complaints that it was too heavy? Instead of opening one bag, I’m opening two.

"R24JYJJYNY8V17","Jennifer W.","Scoop away is the most effective and efficient litter. This company delivered 4 days earlier than promised. Four separate and sealed bundles of litter. It's the genuine Scoop Away brand. Not a knock off as someone else claimed.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 11 de febrero de 2021","Best kitty litter. Real deal.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R2SWGXFZTSQNHY","Allen","I have found the Scoop Away product to be the best product for the money. Many of the other products get muddy and do not clump well, so you end up using more product than necessary.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 1 de febrero de 2021","The Best Product For The Money","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",

"R3FQV2QN62QJE7","Amazon Customer","Does well hiding the stinkies and does not seem to get tracked outside the litter box. Have used this brand for years and it's still the best.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 18 de enero de 2021","Best choice for us","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R2K75BYKJS3JSU","Amanda Gray","Love the litter and packaging helped a ton since I was getting over surgery and couldnt lift!  But super dusty - boxes are in furnace room and dust has been caking my filters.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 17 de enero de 2021","Good litter, but dusty","4.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"RBZJ9A30I8CMZ","T. Carnley","I used Tidy Cat for years, but bought Scoop Away one day when there was no Tidy Cat available.  Loved it so much better, it's all I buy now.  The pieces are smaller and therefore get caught better in my liter mat and stay off my floors so much better.  Does a great job of clumping, too.  I'm a convert.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 31 de diciembre de 2020","Small so it gets trapped better in my liter mat, and off my floors","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
"R1SZHDP05ZHJIQ","Shirlee Feeny","We have use this product for years. When we found this same weight divided in four separate packages made it absolutely perfect to be able to handle. Of course scoop away is the best product for us in our two cats. We only buy the four individual packages in one now. That’s due to it not being so heavy when using it.","Revisado en los Estados Unidos el 10 de diciembre de 2020","NOT HEAVY anymore with the Four individual packages.","5.0 de 5 estrellas","","0",
